## üöÄ How to Run (Very Important!)

1.  Create a project folder. Inside it, create `index.html`, a `css` folder, and a `js` folder.
2.  Place the code for `style.css` inside the `css` folder.
3.  Place the code for `live-background.js`, `data.js`, `visualizations.js`, and `main.js` inside the `js` folder.
4.  **You must run this project from a local server.**
    * **Easy Method (VS Code):** Install the "Live Server" extension. Right-click on `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server."
    * **Python Method:** In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run `python -m http.server`. Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
